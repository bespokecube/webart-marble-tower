# Marble Tower

["Marble Tower"](https://webart-marble-tower.bespokecube.com/) is the first 3D artwork I created using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) to explore how my passion for [3D art](https://www.instagram.com/bespokecube/) intersects with my web development skills.

I’m pretty happy with how it’s turning out and plan to create more, so keep an eye on my GitHub if you’re interested.

Feel free to use and modify this R3F project or the Blender files found in [this folder](https://github.com/bespokecube/webart-marble-tower/tree/main/Resources) as a starting point for your own projects. However, if you use it as-is or almost as-is, please give me a mention.
